# Ecommerce data set with randomly generated data
This dataset was randomly generated.
I will not push the data set here as I do not own it. Please refer to the root folder of this repo for more information where I got it from.

This was another exercise to really drive home the core features of Pandas.
After I had completed the SF Salaries exercise this felt rather easy.
