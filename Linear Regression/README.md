# Linear regression
The goal of this exercise was to familiarize myself with linear regression.
I was given a dataset with created data about a Ecommerce company.
Operations done to the data include
- initializing linear regression model
- fit
- train test split
- MAE, MSA, RMSE 
- few plots with seaborn
