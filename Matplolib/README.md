# pythonML
The idea for this exercise was to mimic graphs drawn already and try to recreate the same figures with my own code.
When run this code creates five different figures. 
- Fig one is just a normal figure.
- Fig two is a figure with a smaller figure embedded on the canvas
- Fig three is a figure with a smaller figure embedded on the canvas with customized limits
- Fig four has two different figures side by side
- Fig five has two different figures side by side adjusted figsize
