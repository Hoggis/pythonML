# pythonML
I am currently working on a Udemy course by [Jose Portilla Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). 
I will be pushing all of the work from the course that I am able to write without assistance to this repo. 
However, I will only push the work I do for the exercises. I will not publish the course material.

Each of the sections will have their own README which will describe what is in each section.

## Main objectives of this project
