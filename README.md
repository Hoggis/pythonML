# pythonML
I am currently working on a Udemy course by [Jose Portilla Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). 
I will be pushing all of the work from the course that I am able to write without assistance to this repo. 
However, I will only push the work I do for the exercises. I will not publish the course material.

Each of the sections will have their own README which will describe what is in each section.

## Main objectives of this project
- Refresh knowledge with NumPy, Panda, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Become comfortable with Machine Learning


## Completed work so far
- Python Crash Course
- NumPy section 
- Pandas section (Exercises uploaded: Kaggle salaries, Ecommerce with randomly generated data)
- Matplotlib (Goal set: 24.8, Goal achieved: 20.8)
- Seaborn (Extra goal set: 24.8, Goal achieved 25.8)
- Plotly & Cufflinks (completed 31.8, but no exercises on the course so will not upload course materials
- Pandas visualization completed to compensate (Extra work. Completed 31.8)

## On going:
### Personal Goal: Finish projects by 11.9.2020
