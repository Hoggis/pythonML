# pythonML
I am currently working on a Udemy course by [Jose Portilla Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). 
I will be pushing all of the work from the course that I am able to write without assistance to this repo. 
However, I will only push the work I do for the exercises. I will not publish the course material.

Each of the sections will have their own README which will describe what is in each section.

All of the work is done with Jupyter Notebooks, but uploaded as Python files

## Main objectives of this project
- Refresh knowledge with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Become comfortable with Machine Learning


## Completed work so far
- Python Crash Course
- NumPy section 
- Pandas section (Exercises uploaded: Kaggle salaries, Ecommerce with randomly generated data)
- Matplotlib (Goal set: 24.8, Goal achieved: 20.8)
- Seaborn (Extra goal set: 24.8, Goal achieved 25.8)
- Plotly & Cufflinks (completed 31.8, but no exercises on the course so will not upload course materials)
- Pandas visualization completed to compensate (Extra work. Completed 31.8)
- Data Capstone Projects (Goal set: 11.9.2020, completed 15.9.2020. Finance proved harder than expected)
  - 911
  - Finanace
- Linear regression (Goal set: 21.9.2020, Goal achieved: 25.9.2020)

## On going:
### Machine Learning by 27.9.2020
- Cross validation

## Up comming
- Logistic regression
- K Nearest Neighbour
